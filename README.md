Get your spice cake mix and add the necessary eggs, oil and water. Add in some shredded carrots and crushed walnuts. Mix altogether and make sure that the lumps from the cake mix are gone.
Make sure you cut your parchment into the contaners so they dont stick. Add in your batter and slide your cake into the oven to bake for 20-30 min or until a inserted toothpick comes out clean. Take your cake out of the oven and make sure that you let your cake cool or the frosting will melt atop it. 
Using an electric mixer or wisk, get a bowland put one 8oz cream cheese and mix till a little soft. Add in softened butter and mix together. Slowly add powdered sugar and wait till it is your wanted sweetness. Add in a bit of vanilla and mix it in. If frosting is too think, then put in a bit of milk or if too moist stick in a fridge or a cold place. Pipe your frosting and take your cakes out and decorate however wanted. Then Enjoy.
